# This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
The user will be presented with a menu of **three** options:
	+**Option 1**: Allows the user to add to the inventory of cars
	+**Option 2**: Displays the inventory of cars, sorted by year
	+**Option 3**: Quits the inventory
The user will be asked to choose one of these options and depending on the user's choice the script will perform the action of the option chosen.

*The inventory of cars is stored in the file "My_old_cars".*
